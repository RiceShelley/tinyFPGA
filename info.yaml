  top_module:  "tinyFPGA"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml
